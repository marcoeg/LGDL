## Metrics to Measure

### Resolution Metrics
- **First-contact resolution rate**: % of issues resolved without escalation
- **Turns to resolution**: Average turns per issue type
  - Login: Target 3 turns
  - Password reset: Target 2 turns
  - Billing: Target 3 turns
  - Device: Target 3 turns

### Slot-Filling Metrics
- **Slot completion rate**: % of conversations where all required slots filled
- **Validation failures**: Should be <5% (only on invalid input)
- **Prompts per conversation**: Should match required slot count

### Capability Metrics
- **Success rate by capability**:
  - auth.verify_user: >95%
  - auth.send_reset_link: >95%
  - billing.get_invoices: >98%
- **Capability latency**: <100ms P95 for mocks
- **Failure handling**: Verify escalation on capability timeout/error

### User Experience Metrics
- **Negotiation trigger rate**: Unclear_support should be <10% of conversations
- **Confidence distribution**: Most flows should be medium-high confidence
- **Escalation rate**: <5% should escalate to human

## Slot Design Patterns

### Pattern 1: Account Identification
```lgdl
slots {
  account_id: string required
}
# OR
slots {
  username: string optional
  email: string optional
}
```

**Usage**: Every authenticated operation
**Validation**: Format check (email regex, account ID pattern)

### Pattern 2: Multi-Option Selection
```lgdl
slots {
  topic: enum("invoice", "plan", "refund") required
  channel: enum("email", "sms") required
  device_type: enum("ios", "android", "web", "desktop") required
}
```

**Usage**: Routing to specific sub-flows
**Benefits**: Type-safe, validates input, enables branching

### Pattern 3: Conditional Slot Requirements
```lgdl
when slot new_plan is missing and slot action is not "cancel" {
  prompt slot: "Which plan would you like to switch to?"
}
```

**Usage**: new_plan only required for upgrade/downgrade, not cancel
**Note**: v1.0 doesn't support conditional logic in slot definitions directly,
but you can use conditional prompts in when blocks

---

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Verify Then Act
```lgdl
when all_slots_filled {
  auth.verify_user for "verification" await timeout 2
}

when successful {
  auth.send_reset_link for "reset" await timeout 2
}
```

**Benefits**: Don't send reset link if account doesn't exist

### Pattern 2: Lookup Then Display
```lgdl
when all_slots_filled {
  billing.get_invoices for "lookup" await timeout 3
}

when successful {
  respond with: "Found: {invoice_date}, {invoice_amount}"
}
```

**Benefits**: Capability data available in template

### Pattern 3: Check Status Then Troubleshoot
```lgdl
when all_slots_filled {
  device.check_status for "diagnostics" await timeout 2
}

when successful {
  respond with: "Service operational. Try: 1) Log out 2) Clear cache"
}

when failed {
  respond with: "Platform experiencing issues. ETA: {eta}"
}
```

**Benefits**: Different advice based on platform status

## Testing

### Functional Testing
```bash
# Test login flow
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/games/support/move \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"conversation_id": "test1", "user_id": "test", "input": "I cant log in"}'
```

### Load Testing
```python
# Locust scenario
class SupportUser(HttpUser):
    @task(weight=5)
    def login_issue(self):
        # Simulate 3-turn login flow

    @task(weight=2)
    def billing_inquiry(self):
        # Simulate 3-turn billing flow

    @task(weight=3)
    def device_issue(self):
        # Simulate 3-turn device flow
```

**Target**: 100 concurrent support conversations, P95 <500ms

### A/B Testing
Compare automated support vs human agent:
- Resolution time
- Customer satisfaction
- Escalation rate

## Production Deployment Notes

### Capability Integration

**Mock (Development)**:
```python
# In lgdl/runtime/capability.py
def _verify_user(self, payload):
    return {"status": "ok", "user_found": True}
```

**Production**:
```python
# Real integration
async def _verify_user(self, payload):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(
            f"{AUTH_SERVICE_URL}/verify",
            json=payload,
            headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {AUTH_TOKEN}"}
        )
    return response.json()
```

### Rate Limiting Considerations

**L1 Support** typically sees:
- 1000-5000 conversations/day
- Peak hours: 9am-5pm local time
- Average conversation: 2-4 turns
- Total turns/day: 4000-20000

**Recommended Limits**:
```python
LGDL_RATE_LIMIT_USER=20/minute  # Higher than medical (users retry more)
LGDL_RATE_LIMIT_CONVERSATION=30/minute
```

### Escalation Integration

When `escalate to: human_agent` triggers:
```python
# Create support ticket
# Add to agent queue
# Notify user of wait time
# Transfer conversation context
```

## Common Support Patterns

### Fast Resolution (2 turns)
- Password reset: request â†’ email â†’ done
- Account unlock: complaint â†’ username â†’ unlocked

### Standard Resolution (3 turns)
- Login issue: complaint â†’ credentials â†’ channel â†’ done
- Billing: complaint â†’ account â†’ topic â†’ results
- Device: complaint â†’ platform â†’ error â†’ troubleshooting

### Complex Resolution (4+ turns)
- Plan change: request â†’ account â†’ action â†’ new plan â†’ confirmed
- Multi-symptom device issues

### Escalation Needed
- Account locked for suspicious activity (manual review)
- Billing disputes (human judgment)
- Complex technical issues

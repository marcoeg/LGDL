# LGDL Slot-Filling Guide (v1.0)

**Status**: Production-ready (v1.0)
**Prerequisites**: StateManager enabled for persistence
**Use Cases**: Multi-turn information gathering, structured data collection, progressive form filling

---

## Overview

Slot-filling enables moves to declaratively define required and optional information slots, automatically prompt users for missing data, validate responses, and execute capabilities only when all required slots are filled.

### Problem Solved
Without slot-filling, games must use verbose pattern matching with duplicate triggers for every possible response combination, leading to repeated questions and poor multi-turn UX.

### Solution
Declarative slot definitions that automatically manage progressive information gathering:

```lgdl
move pain_assessment {
  slots {
    location: string required
    severity: range(1, 10) required
    onset: timeframe required
  }

  when slot location is missing {
    prompt slot: "Where does it hurt?"
  }

  when all_slots_filled {
    respond with: "I understand you have {severity}/10 pain in your {location}."
  }
}
```

---

## Slot Types

### string
Free-text input with no validation.

```lgdl
location: string required
```

**Examples**: "my chest", "left arm", "head"

### number
Numeric values with automatic extraction from text.

```lgdl
age: number optional
```

**Examples**:
- Input: "30" → Extracts: 30.0
- Input: "I'm 25 years old" → Extracts: 25.0

### range(min, max)
Bounded numeric values with inclusive min/max validation.

```lgdl
severity: range(1, 10) required
```

**Examples**:
- Input: "8" → Valid (8.0)
- Input: "8 out of 10" → Valid (8.0)
- Input: "11" → Invalid (exceeds max)

**Note**: Range bounds are inclusive: `range(1, 10)` accepts 1.0, 1.5, ..., 10.0

### enum(val1, val2, ...)
Enumerated choices with exact, partial, and case-insensitive matching.

```lgdl
urgency: enum("low", "medium", "high") required
```

**Examples**:
- Input: "high" → Matches "high"
- Input: "HIGH" → Matches "high" (case-insensitive)
- Input: "I think it's medium" → Matches "medium" (partial match)

### timeframe
Duration expressions with pattern matching for units and natural phrases.

```lgdl
onset: timeframe required
```

**Supported patterns**:
- "2 hours", "30 minutes", "1 week", "3 days"
- "just now", "recently", "yesterday", "a while ago"

**Examples**:
- "started 2 hours ago" → Valid
- "yesterday" → Valid
- "not a timeframe" → Invalid

### date
Date formats (ISO, US, dashed).

```lgdl
appointment_date: date required
```

**Supported formats**:
- ISO: `2025-10-31`
- US: `10/31/2025`, `10/31/25`
- Dashed: `31-10-2025`

**Note**: Production systems should use dateutil or similar for comprehensive parsing.

---

## Slot Modifiers

### required
Slot must be filled before move executes (default behavior).

```lgdl
location: string required  # Explicitly required
severity: number           # Implicitly required (default)
```

### optional
Slot is not required for move execution.

```lgdl
characteristics: string optional
```

### default(value)
Provides default value when slot not filled.

```lgdl
count: number default(1)
```

**Behavior**: Slot with default value is not considered "missing" and won't be prompted.

---

## Slot Conditions

### when slot X is missing
Triggers when a specific required slot is not filled.

```lgdl
when slot location is missing {
  prompt slot: "Where does it hurt?"
}
```

**Precedence**: Prompts are shown in order of first missing slot.

### when all_slots_filled
Triggers when all required slots have valid values.

```lgdl
when all_slots_filled {
  respond with: "Thank you. I understand you have {severity}/10 pain in your {location}."
  medical.assess_pain(location, severity, onset)
}
```

**Behavior**:
- Actions execute only when all required slots filled
- Filled slot values available in template context
- Slots cleared after successful execution

---

## Slot-Filling Flow

### Precedence Order
1. **Pattern-captured params**: `{location}` in pattern extracts value directly
2. **Type-specific extraction**: For number/range, extracts first number from input
3. **Whole input fallback**: For string/timeframe/date, uses entire input
4. **Prompt user**: If slot still missing after extraction

### Multi-Turn Example

```
Turn 1:
User:    "I'm in pain"
System:  [Matches pain_assessment, location missing]
         "Where does it hurt?"

Turn 2:
User:    "My chest"
System:  [Fills location="chest", severity missing]
         "On a scale of 1-10, how severe is the pain?"

Turn 3:
User:    "8 out of 10"
System:  [Extracts 8.0, fills severity=8.0, onset missing]
         "When did this pain start?"

Turn 4:
User:    "About an hour ago"
System:  [Fills onset="1 hour", all slots filled]
         "Thank you. I understand you have 8/10 pain in your chest."
```

---

## Pattern Integration

Slot names can be used as pattern placeholders for automatic extraction:

```lgdl
move booking {
  slots {
    doctor: string required
    date: date required
  }

  when user says something like: [
    "book with Dr. {doctor} on {date}",
    "appointment with {doctor}"
  ]

  # Pattern captures fill slots automatically
}
```

**Behavior**: When pattern `"book with Dr. {doctor} on {date}"` matches input `"book with Dr. Smith on 2025-11-15"`, the captured values automatically fill the slots.

---

## Implementation Details

### IR Structure

Moves with slots compile to IR with:

```json
{
  "id": "pain_assessment",
  "slots": {
    "location": {
      "type": "string",
      "required": true,
      "default": null
    },
    "severity": {
      "type": "range",
      "min": 1.0,
      "max": 10.0,
      "required": true
    }
  },
  "slot_prompts": {
    "location": "Where does it hurt?",
    "severity": "On a scale of 1-10, how severe?"
  },
  "slot_conditions": {
    "all_slots_filled": [
      {"type": "respond", "data": {...}}
    ]
  }
}
```

### Storage

Slots are persisted through the StateManager's storage backend:

```sql
CREATE TABLE slots (
    conversation_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    move_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    slot_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    slot_value TEXT NOT NULL,
    slot_type TEXT,
    updated_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (conversation_id, move_id, slot_name)
)
```

**Persistence**:
- Slots survive process restarts (when using SQLite/PostgreSQL/Redis backend)
- Isolated per conversation and per move
- Cleared automatically after `all_slots_filled` actions execute

### Runtime Behavior

When a move has slots, the runtime:

1. Attempts to fill slots from pattern params and user input
2. Validates values against type constraints
3. If required slots missing: returns early with `awaiting_slot` field
4. If all required slots filled: executes `all_slots_filled` actions
5. Clears slots after successful execution

**Response fields**:
- `awaiting_slot`: Name of slot being prompted for (when waiting)
- `slots_filled`: Dict of filled values (when complete)

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Slot Granularity
**Do**: One concept per slot
```lgdl
slots {
  location: string required
  severity: range(1, 10) required
}
```

**Don't**: Combine multiple concepts
```lgdl
slots {
  pain_description: string required  # Too broad - "chest, 8/10, started an hour ago"
}
```

### 2. Validation
**Do**: Use specific types with constraints
```lgdl
age: range(0, 120) required
urgency: enum("low", "medium", "high", "critical") required
```

**Don't**: Use string for everything
```lgdl
age: string required  # No validation
urgency: string required  # No validation
```

### 3. Optional Slots
**Do**: Make non-critical information optional
```lgdl
characteristics: string optional  # Additional details
```

**Don't**: Make everything required
```lgdl
characteristics: string required  # Forces user to answer
```

### 4. Prompts
**Do**: Ask clear, specific questions
```lgdl
when slot severity is missing {
  prompt slot: "On a scale of 1-10, how severe is the pain?"
}
```

**Don't**: Use vague prompts
```lgdl
when slot severity is missing {
  prompt slot: "Tell me more"  # Unclear what to provide
}
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Test slot validation, extraction, and storage independently:

```python
def test_slot_validation_range(slot_manager):
    slot_def = {"type": "range", "min": 1.0, "max": 10.0}
    valid, value = slot_manager.validate_slot_value(slot_def, 5)
    assert valid is True
    assert value == 5.0
```

### Integration Tests
Test full slot-filling flow with runtime:

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_multi_turn_slot_filling():
    # Turn 1: Initial input
    result1 = await runtime.process_turn(conv_id, "user1", "I'm in pain", {})
    assert result1["awaiting_slot"] == "location"

    # Turn 2: Provide location
    result2 = await runtime.process_turn(conv_id, "user1", "chest", {})
    assert result2["awaiting_slot"] == "severity"

    # Turn 3: Provide severity
    result3 = await runtime.process_turn(conv_id, "user1", "8", {})
    assert "slots_filled" in result3
```

---

## Performance

### Latency
- **Slot validation**: < 1ms (regex-based)
- **Slot storage (SQLite)**: < 5ms (single INSERT)
- **Slot retrieval (SQLite)**: < 3ms (indexed SELECT)

### Scaling
- Slots indexed by (conversation_id, move_id, slot_name)
- Automatic cleanup on conversation deletion (CASCADE)
- No N+1 queries (batch retrieval available)

---

## Limitations

### Current (v1.0)
1. **Simple extraction**: Returns whole input for string/timeframe/date
2. **No nested slots**: Flat structure only
3. **No slot inheritance**: Slots are per-move, not shared
4. **No conditional requirements**: All required slots must be filled

### Future Enhancements (v1.1+)
1. **LLM/NER extraction**: Use language model for entity extraction
2. **Nested slots**: Support complex/structured slot types
3. **Conditional slots**: `when X filled, Y required`
4. **Custom validators**: User-defined validation functions
5. **Slot relationships**: Dependencies between slots

---

## Migration Guide

### From Pattern-Only to Slots

**Before** (verbose, repeated patterns):
```lgdl
move pain_assessment {
  when user says something like: [
    "I'm in pain",
    "pain in {location}",
    "severity {level}",
    "started {time} ago",
    // 20+ pattern variations
  ]

  when confident {
    respond with: "I understand... [asks more questions]"
  }
}
```

**After** (declarative slots):
```lgdl
move pain_assessment {
  slots {
    location: string required
    severity: range(1, 10) required
    onset: timeframe required
  }

  when user says something like: [
    "I'm in pain",
    "pain in {location}"
  ]

  when slot location is missing {
    prompt slot: "Where does it hurt?"
  }

  when slot severity is missing {
    prompt slot: "On a scale of 1-10, how severe?"
  }

  when slot onset is missing {
    prompt slot: "When did this pain start?"
  }

  when all_slots_filled {
    respond with: "Thank you. I understand you have {severity}/10 pain in your {location}."
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduced patterns (20+ → 2)
- No repeated questions
- Type-safe validation
- Clear progressive flow

## API Reference

### SlotManager

#### Methods

```python
async def get_missing_slots(move: dict, conversation_id: str) -> List[str]
```
Returns list of required slots not yet filled.

```python
def validate_slot_value(slot_def: dict, value: Any) -> Tuple[bool, Any]
```

  slots {
    name: string required
    email: string required
    age: number optional
  }

  when user says something like: [
    "I want to register",
    "sign up"
  ]

  when slot name is missing {
    prompt slot: "What's your name?"
  }

  when slot email is missing {
    prompt slot: "What's your email address?"

  slots {
    product: string required
    quantity: number default(1)
    size: enum("small", "medium", "large") optional
  }

  when user says something like: [
    "add {product} to cart",
    "I want {quantity} {product}"
  ]

  when slot product is missing {
    prompt slot: "Which product would you like?"
  }

  }

  when all_slots_filled {
    respond with: "Thank you. I understand you have {severity}/10 pain in your {location} that started {onset}. Let me assess the urgency."
    medical.assess_pain(location, severity, onset, characteristics) for "pain assessment" timeout 3
  }

  when successful {
    respond with: "Based on your symptoms, urgency level is {urgency}. Estimated wait time: {wait_time} minutes."
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Slots not persisting across restarts
**Cause**: StateManager not configured
**Fix**: Ensure runtime has StateManager with persistent storage:
```python
storage = SQLiteStateStorage()
state_manager = StateManager(persistent_storage=storage)
runtime = LGDLRuntime(compiled, state_manager=state_manager)
```

### Repeated prompts for same slot
**Cause**: Slot value not passing validation
**Fix**: Check slot type constraints match expected input:
```lgdl
# Wrong: range too narrow
severity: range(5, 10) required  # User says "3" → rejected

# Right: appropriate range
severity: range(1, 10) required  # User says "3" → accepted
```

### Slot extracted incorrectly
**Cause**: Pattern params or extraction logic
**Fix**: Check pattern placeholder names match slot names:
```lgdl
# Wrong: different names
slots { location: string required }
when user says: ["pain in {body_part}"]  # Captures "body_part", not "location"

# Right: matching names
slots { location: string required }
when user says: ["pain in {location}"]  # Captures "location" correctly
```

### all_slots_filled never triggers
**Cause**: Optional slots or validation failures
**Fix**: Verify required slots and check validation:
```python
# Debug: check which slots are missing
missing = await slot_manager.get_missing_slots(move, conversation_id)
print(f"Missing slots: {missing}")

# Debug: check filled slots
filled = await slot_manager.get_slot_values(move["id"], conversation_id)
print(f"Filled slots: {filled}")
```

## 🎯 What We Built

### 1. Propose-Only Learning ✅

**CRITICAL SAFETY FEATURE**:

```python
# Pattern discovered from successful negotiation
interaction = Interaction(
    user_input="My ticker hurts",
    outcome="success",
    negotiation_rounds=2,
    final_understanding="pain in chest"
)

await learning_engine.learn_from_interaction(interaction)

# RESULT:
# ✅ Proposal created with status=PENDING
# ✅ NOT in active patterns (not deployed)
# ✅ Awaits human review
# ❌ NEVER auto-approved
```

**Verified by test**: `test_propose_only_never_auto_deploys` ✅

---

### 2. Pattern Proposal Generation

**From Successful Negotiations**:
```
User: "My ticker hurts" → Low confidence
Assistant: "Can you clarify?"
User: "My chest" → Success

→ Proposes: "My {body_part} is bothering me"
   Status: PENDING
   Source: NEGOTIATION_SUCCESS
```

**From User Variations**:
```
User says "ticker pain"
→ Matches existing "heart pain" pattern
→ If frequency > 3 and success_rate > 70%
→ Proposes "ticker pain" as new pattern
```

---

### 3. Shadow Testing (Safety)

**Before Human Review**:
```python
# Test proposal on 1000 historical conversations
results = await shadow_tester.test_proposal(proposal)

# Results:
results.total_tested = 1000
results.regressions = 12  # Conversations that got worse
results.improvements = 45  # Conversations that got better
results.regression_rate = 0.012  # 1.2% (LOW risk)

# Risk assessment:
if regression_rate > 0.1: risk = "high"
elif regression_rate > 0.05: risk = "medium"
else: risk = "low"  # ✅ This case
```

**Verified by test**: `test_shadow_testing_detects_regressions` ✅

---

### 4. Review Workflow

**Human Approval Process**:
```python
# 1. Prepare for review
enriched = await review.prepare_for_review(proposal_id)
# Returns:
# - Proposal with shadow test results
# - Risk assessment (low/medium/high)
# - Similar patterns comparison
# - LLM recommendation

# 2. Human reviews and decides
await review.approve_proposal(
    proposal_id="abc123",
    reviewer_id="alice",  # REQUIRED
    notes="Good pattern, clear improvement"
)

# Result:
# ✅ Proposal status → APPROVED
# ✅ reviewed_by → "alice"
# ✅ review_timestamp → now
# ✅ Pattern deployed to runtime
```

**Verified by test**: `test_review_workflow_approve` ✅

---

### 5. Confidence Adjustment

**Learn from Outcomes**:
```python
# Success → +0.05 confidence
interaction(outcome="success", pattern="test")
→ pattern confidence: 0.75 → 0.80

# Failure → -0.05 confidence
interaction(outcome="failure", pattern="test")
→ pattern confidence: 0.80 → 0.75
```

**Verified by tests**: `test_confidence_boost_on_success`, `test_confidence_reduction_on_failure` ✅

---

### 6. Vocabulary Expansion Discovery

**LLM Analyzes Negotiations**:
```
User: "my ticker"
Clarified: "chest pain"

LLM analyzes:
→ Detects: "ticker" is synonym for "chest/heart"
→ Proposes: Add "ticker" to vocabulary["chest"]
→ Status: PENDING (awaits approval)
```

---

## 🔒 Safety Mechanisms VERIFIED

### 1. Propose-Only Enforcement ✅

**Test result**:
```
test_propose_only_never_auto_deploys: PASSED ✅

Verification:
✅ Proposal created with status=PENDING
✅ NO reviewer_id set (awaiting human)
✅ Pattern NOT in active patterns
✅ Cannot be used until explicitly approved
```

**Code enforcement**:
```python
# In LearningEngine._propose_from_negotiation():
proposal.status = ProposalStatus.PENDING  # ALWAYS pending

# In ReviewWorkflow.approve_proposal():
if proposal.status != ProposalStatus.PENDING:
    raise ValueError("Only PENDING can be approved")

proposal.reviewed_by = reviewer_id  # MUST have reviewer
```

---

### 2. Shadow Testing Safety ✅

**Test result**:
```
test_shadow_test_basic: PASSED ✅

Verification:
✅ Tests on historical conversations
✅ Calculates regression_rate
✅ Flags high-risk proposals
✅ Provides recommendations
```

**Thresholds**:
- <5% regression: LOW risk → Likely approve
- 5-10% regression: MEDIUM risk → Review carefully
- >10% regression: HIGH risk → Likely reject

---

### 3. Human Review Required ✅

**Test result**:
```
test_approval_requires_reviewer_id: PASSED ✅
test_cannot_approve_non_pending: PASSED ✅

Verification:
✅ reviewer_id required for approval
✅ Only PENDING can be approved
✅ Approval logged with timestamp
✅ Rejection requires reason
```

---

### 4. Audit Trail ✅

**All actions logged**:
- Proposal creation: timestamp, source, interactions
- Approval: reviewer_id, timestamp, notes
- Rejection: reviewer_id, timestamp, reason
- Reversion: reviewer_id, timestamp, reason

→ Confidence: 0.45 (below threshold)
→ Action: Negotiate
